<p class="content">
    The main goal of HAT is to analyse handwriting styles of different scribes and sort them according to their
    similarity to specific (possibly unknown) handwriting styles. A similarity score will be produced for each of the different
    handwriting styles (scribes) so that the user can have a relative comparison between the similarities of handwriting styles
    with respect to specific handwriting styles (possibly from unknown scribes).
