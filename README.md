# Handwriting-Analysis-Tool-HAT

Handwriting Analysis Tool (HAT) is a software tool that can be used to analyse handwriting styles. Several different handwriting styles (scribal hands) can be analysed concurrently and sorted according to their similarity to a questioned or unknown style (query). A similarity score will be calculated for each predefined style (scribal hand) to create a relative comparison between them with respect to an unknown style.

The analysis results can be useful for:
- Providing quantitative similarity measurements as a supporting information.
- Providing additional support for the work-flow of scholars in manuscript research.
- Identifying certain scribes, handwriting styles and schools of writing.
- Dating manuscripts based on the gradual change in handwriting styles.
